# House Price Prediction Project

This project focuses on predicting house prices using machine learning models, specifically Linear Regression and Random Forest Regression. The dataset used for this project contains various features related to house attributes. The project includes data preprocessing, visualization, outlier handling, and model evaluation.

## Getting Started

To run the code in this repository, you can follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/house-price-prediction.git
```

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook in your preferred environment (e.g., Google Colab).

3. Ensure you have the necessary libraries and dependencies installed, such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `seaborn`, and `matplotlib`.

4. Execute the code cells in the Jupyter Notebook to perform data preprocessing, visualization, and model training and evaluation.

## Code Overview

- **Data Preprocessing**: The project begins with importing the dataset, dropping unnecessary columns, handling missing values, and converting data types.

- **Data Visualization**: Visualizations are used to explore the data, including price distribution, count plots for categorical variables, and box plots for numeric features.

- **Outlier Detection**: Outliers are identified using Z-scores, and a new dataset is created without outliers.

- **Correlation Analysis**: The correlations between numeric variables are visualized in a heatmap to understand feature relationships.

- **Modeling**: Linear Regression and Random Forest Regression models are trained on the data to predict house prices.

- **Model Evaluation**: Model performance is evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R2) scores.

## Results

- Linear Regression Model:
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE): 34530973639.27
  - R-squared (R2): 0.52

- Random Forest Regression Model:
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE): 50268525187.06
  - R-squared (R2): 0.31
